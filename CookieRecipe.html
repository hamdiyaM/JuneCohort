            <h3>Ingredients </h3>
            
            <!-- List of ingredients below  -->
            <ul>
                <li>100 g of granulated sugar</li>
                <li>165 g packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>115 g of unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 egg </li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>155 g of all pupose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>110 g milk chocolate chunks</li>
                <li>110 g dark chocolate chunks</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol> 
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
                <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before <br> falling back into the mixture.</li>
                <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause <br>the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
                <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color,<br> chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies<br> and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
                <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
                <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
